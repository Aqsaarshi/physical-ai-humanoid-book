# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: 2025-12-04 | **Spec**: specs/physical-ai-robotics-textbook/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Generate a university-level textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, covering 10-15 chapters with detailed explanations, real-world examples, diagrams, practical tasks, quizzes, and references. The textbook will be integrated into a Docusaurus website and published to a GitHub repository.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Markdown (for chapters), JavaScript/Node.js (for Docusaurus), HTML/CSS (for Docusaurus output)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus (for static site generation), Git (for version control and GitHub deployment)  
**Storage**: Filesystem (Markdown files for chapters, Docusaurus generated static files)  
**Testing**: Manual validation of chapter content against spec, Docusaurus local server verification (`npm run start`), GitHub repository content verification.  
**Target Platform**: Web browser (Docusaurus output), GitHub Pages (for hosting)
**Project Type**: Web application (static site generated by Docusaurus)  
**Performance Goals**: Fast loading times for web pages (Docusaurus optimized), efficient chapter generation and validation.  
**Constraints**: Textbook content must adhere to scientific accuracy, clarity for beginners, practical application, ethical use, and industry relevance. Chapters must follow a consistent structure. Zero plagiarism. Total pages 80-120. Simple English with technical keywords. PDF-ready content.  
**Scale/Scope**: Single textbook (10-15 chapters), target audience university students and educators.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
