## Dependencies
- Phase 1 (Setup) must be completed before any User Story phases.
- User Story phases can largely be worked on in parallel once foundational tasks are done, but are ordered by priority.
- Global tasks in Phase 5 are mostly dependent on chapter content completion.

## Parallel Execution Examples
- Writing content for different chapters (e.g., T009, T016, T023) can be done in parallel.
- Designing diagrams for different chapters (e.g., T011, T018, T025) can be done in parallel.
- Creating quiz questions for different chapters (e.g., T013, T020, T027) can be done in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy
The implementation will follow an iterative approach, prioritizing User Story 1 (Learning Core Concepts) as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Subsequent user stories and global tasks will be addressed in order of priority and dependency. Each phase will aim to deliver an independently testable increment of the textbook.
