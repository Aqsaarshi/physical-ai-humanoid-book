# Tasks: Update Textbook Chapters

**Feature Name**: Update Textbook Chapters
**Feature Branch**: `1-update-textbook-chapters`
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Spec Link**: `history/prompts/update-textbook-chapters/1-update-textbook-chapters.spec.prompt.md`

## Phase 1: Setup
*(No setup tasks identified for this feature)*

## Phase 2: Foundational
*(No foundational tasks identified for this feature)*

## Phase 3: User Story 1: Review 5-Chapter Textbook Structure (Priority: P1)

**Story Goal**: As a user, I want to review the high-level structure of the textbook to understand its flow and content distribution across 5 chapters, ensuring it covers the core topics efficiently.

**Independent Test Criteria**: The updated specification explicitly lists exactly 5 chapters, and core topics are logically spread across them.

### Implementation Tasks

- [X] T001 [US1] Confirm FR-001 (textbook contains exactly 5 chapters) in `history/prompts/update-textbook-chapters/1-update-textbook-chapters.spec.prompt.md`
- [X] T002 [US1] Verify FR-002 (each of the 5 chapters covers distinct and logically sequential topics) in `history/prompts/update-textbook-chapters/1-update-textbook-chapters.spec.prompt.md`
- [X] T003 [US1] Validate FR-003 (overall content comprehensively covered within 5 chapters) in `history/prompts/update-textbook-chapters/1-update-textbook-chapters.spec.prompt.md`
- [X] T004 [US1] Check SC-001 (TOC/outline explicitly lists 5 chapters) in `history/prompts/update-textbook-chapters/1-update-textbook-chapters.spec.prompt.md`
- [X] T005 [US1] Review SC-002 (feedback indicates clear and logical progression of topics across 5 chapters) based on the current spec in `history/prompts/update-textbook-chapters/1-update-textbook-chapters.spec.prompt.md`
- [X] T006 [US1] Audit SC-003 (essential concepts covered within 5 chapters) in `history/prompts/update-textbook-chapters/1-update-textbook-chapters.spec.prompt.md`

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
*(No polish or cross-cutting tasks identified for this feature)*

## Dependencies

User Story 1: Review 5-Chapter Textbook Structure has no external dependencies.

## Parallel Execution Examples

All tasks for User Story 1 can be performed sequentially to confirm the spec. No explicit parallelization opportunities were identified as the goal is a review of a single document.

## Implementation Strategy

This feature is a specification update, so the implementation strategy is to verify the consistency and correctness of the "in-memory" specification generated earlier. The tasks reflect steps to audit the specification against its requirements and success criteria.
